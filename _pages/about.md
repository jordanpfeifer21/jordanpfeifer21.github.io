<!-- I’m the head of the Fundamental AI (FunAI) Lab and full Professor at the University of Technology Nuremberg. Prior to this, I lead the QUVA lab at the University of Amsterdam, where I closely collaborated with Qualcomm AI Research. My PhD was at the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford, where I worked with Andrea Vedaldi and Christian Rupprecht. Also, I love running, the mountains ⛰️ and their combination.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm a GNC engineer at [Vatn Systems](https://www.vatnsystems.com/) and a recent grad from Brown University with degrees in Mathematical Physics and Computer Science. Prior to this, I contributed to deep learning research at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](https://home.cern/) as well as astrophysics and cosmology research at [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/). 

For fun, I've helped design, build, and compete with a formula-one style racecar as a part of [Brown Formula Racing](https://www.brownformularacing.com/home).
